## ✨ Inspiration ✨
When I started my tech blogging journey, I realized that code snippets play a very important role. But code snippets are boring to look at if they are just plain markdown text. 
So why not make Code Snippets eye-catching and cool?
This led to the birth of **CodeSnap**!

## ✨ What it does ✨
CodeSnap is a code snippet image generator. It has a **built-in code editor** with **syntax-highlighting** abilities. Multiple programming languages are supported (HTML, Javascript, and C among many). 
The Code snippet can be downloaded as an image once the editing is completed.
There are various **themes** available to make the snippets look cool and trendy!
There is also a mode switching option to toggle between **dark and light mode** to make sure snippets are supported on websites with dark mode as well!

## 💻🧰 How I built it 🔧🔨
CodeSnap is a web app built using ReactJS for the frontend, flask for the backend, Auth0 for providing easy authentication, and **CockroachDB** for storing snippet data of the users.

## ❗ Challenges we ran into ❗
Converting React components into an image was hard, but I was able to do it by converting it to a canvas element and in turn downloading that!

## ✨ Accomplishments that I am proud of ✨
Building a tool that will be useful for all Developers and Tech bloggers in a time crunch is something I am proud of!

##  💡 What I learned 💡
I learned how to integrate a ReactApp with a Flask backend and CockroachDB!

## What's next for CodeSnap
Providing a dedicated snippets page with top snippets and building a mobile-friendly user interface!
